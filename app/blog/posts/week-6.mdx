# Learnings
## Reflection
Our project this week was to demo a game by Saturday morning. Working in groups for the first time, we needed to decide together a) what we wanted to build and b) how to go about doing that. While we continued refining our knowledge of previously learned technologies, we’d also needed to learn how to communicate as a group.

I was surprised to learn how unsolved of a problem collaborative development is. We quickly tried to establish our own patterns, which did not work very well at first! However, each day got better and we started to roll. By the end of the week, I began to understand the shortcomings and limits of existing practices. So much is just convention! It is surprising so much DevEx (at least, what we experienced in this week) felt like walking through honey. Rao’s concept of ‘tensions’ came to mind. A quick definition c/o o3:
> The basic units of sense-making aren’t “problems” or “trade-offs,” but live, opposing forces—tensions.
> Think of a tension as two incompatible, yet mutually sustaining poles (eg. freedom ↔ security, speed ↔ quality).

Anyways, I also recently watched the second season of Nathan Fielder’s *The Rehearsal*. It deeply investigates the relationship between first officers and pilots of commercial airplanes. He posits that one of the leading unsolved reasons for crashes and accidents is poor communication practices in the cockpit. In many ways, this is also true for software development - with much lower stakes of course. I recommend a watch for anyone working with others in positions of power in the workplace!
## Learned Technologies
- Collaborative Git workflows
- Git Town
- Engine logic with TypeScript
- Animation loop management with TypeScript
- Sound effects

# Wins & Blockers
### Day 1
_Wins_ - was crazy seeing how much progress we made even though we def don’t have a good git workflow setup lol. a lecture or smthng would be nice on conventions, maybe some articles? excited to get a plan going with everyone’s creativity, and get it in front of people to test. finished a draft of my blog for last week too — getting a friend to give me some pointers it b4 i post.

_Blockers_ - git workflow can easily derail us as our app gets more complex. i think we need to have a brainstorm/planning session (and idea tracking documentation? roadmap? spec?) that comes out of that! sort of just started working today.
### Day 2
_Wins_ - nice chat to orient the team in the morning. slower progress today but the game is coming together! i think we made good architectural decisions early on

_Blockers_ - sometimes i am afraid to do work that might get fucked by work others are doing, so i end up waiting. applied to some jobs in this time but feel like i should be more productive and pull my weight!
### Day 3
_Wins_ - game is making progress towards real playability

_Blockers_ - camera zooming is actually hard when there’s a million elements that scale different on the page. got stuck a few times trying to use a spec
### Day 4
_Wins_ - a lot of progress on game polish with the team!!!

_Blockers_ - some painful merge conflicts and deployment details, but working through it. overall, doesn’t seem that bad honestly considering how new we are to collaborating this way
### Day 5
_Wins_ - think we had a rly good flow going most of today with github issues linking to PRs. learned a lot abt how to work productively with a team using git/github this week!

_Blockers_ - attempted a UI change that we probably shouldn’t have this afternoon — ended up reverting changes and lost time to add other improvements. oh well, so it goes.
# How I'm Doing
## 1. How I'm Feeling
- feeling solid. started feeling tired much more often the last two weeks; i'm excited for the break

## 2. Personal Growth & Learning
- working in a SWE team requires much more communication than i initially thought (and is very collaborative). perhaps this is because we initially made our git conventions from the ground up

## 3. Standout Moments
- pulling main and seeing new animations/features appear :)

## 4. Biggest Challenge & How I Handled It
- there were some different opinions on where the game should go... i think i helped the team compromise and move in a direction without spending too much time treading water

## 5. Connections & Collaborations
- ben and dante were excellent team members to work with and learn from

## 6. Habits & Routines
- git workflows, slowly learning to atomize and break up my code more (good practice with commits/PRs too... the *one more thing* feeling is insane when u only have a week to work on something)

## 7. Surprises
- how quickly we started working after having a clean and feature rich engine (was a little slow before that)

## 8. Focus for Next Week
- rest...! and hopefully finishing the soldering of the split keyboard i'm building :)
- also, jobs. talked to andy for a while today about this and i have m list of todos
